## Instructions

A cuboid is a solid figure bounded by six rectangular faces. Its dimensions are its height, width, and depth. Write a Python program in **cuboid.py** that computes and prints the volume of a cuboid, given its height, width, and depth as inputs. The volume is just the product of these three inputs. The output should be labeled as “cubic units.” (LO: 1.4)

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter the height: 6
Enter the width: 8
Enter the depth: 9
The volume is 432.0 cubic units.
```
