## Instructions

The grammar checker of _Case Study 6-1: Recognizing Sentences_ in Chapter 6 (in the file **recognizer.py**) does not handle sentences with an arbitrary number of independent clauses. Use the modified grammar rule discussed in Section 7.1 to design, implement, and test a recursive sentence function that performs this task. (LO: 7.1)

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter a sentence or press return to quit: A girl saw a red bat and a boy hit a ball
Ok, grammatically correct
Enter a sentence or press return to quit: A girl hit a bat a boy hit the ball
Not ok, grammatically incorrect
```

> Note: the second sentence is missing a conjunction
