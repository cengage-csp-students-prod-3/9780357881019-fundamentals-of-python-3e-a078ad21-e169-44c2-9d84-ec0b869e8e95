## Instructions

Write a recursive function that expects a pathname as an argument. The pathname can be either the name of a file or the name of a directory. If the pathname refers to a file, its name is displayed, followed by its contents. Otherwise, if the pathname refers to a directory, the function is applied to each name in the directory. Test this function in a new program (in the file **viewfiles.py**). (LO: 7.1)

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Directory name: /chapter7/ex04/student
File name: /chapter7/ex04/student/text.txt
The girl caught the falling leaf.
Directory name: /chapter7/ex04/student/assets
File name: /chapter7/ex04/student/assets/text.txt
The boy kicked the red ball
```
