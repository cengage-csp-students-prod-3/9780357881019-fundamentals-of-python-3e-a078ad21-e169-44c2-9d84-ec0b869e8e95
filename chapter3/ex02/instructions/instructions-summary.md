## Instructions

Write a program in the file **right.py** that accepts the lengths of three sides of a triangle as inputs. The program output should indicate whether or not the triangle is a right triangle.

Recall from the Pythagorean theorem that in a right triangle, the square of one side equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. (LO: 3.3)

An example of the program is shown below:

```txt
Enter the first side: 6
Enter the second side: 8
Enter the third side: 10

The triangle is a right triangle.
