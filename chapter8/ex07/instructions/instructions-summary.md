## Instructions

Inverting an image makes it look like a photographic negative. Define and test a function named `invert` (in the file **invert.py**). This function expects an image as an argument and resets each RGB component to 255 minus that component. Be sure to test the function with images that have been converted to grayscale and black and white as well as color images. (LO: 8.2)

An example of the program is shown below:

<p align="center">
    <img src="../assets/8.7.png" width="60%" alt="A invert color image titled 'smokey.gif' is shown. The image depicts a cat, likely outdoors, partially obscured by grass and shadows. The catâ€™s face and ears are clearly visible in the center, with strong contrast between light and dark areas giving it a stylized, high-contrast appearance.
">
</p>

```
Enter the image file name: smokey.gif
```
