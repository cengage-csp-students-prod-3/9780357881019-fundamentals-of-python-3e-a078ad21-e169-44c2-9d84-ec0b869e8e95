## Instructions

Define a second version of the `grayscale` function (in the file **grayscale.py**) that uses the allegedly crude method of simply averaging each RGB value. Test the function by comparing its results with those of the other version discussed in this chapter. (LO: 8.2)

An example of the program is shown below:

<p align="center">
    <img src="../assets/8.6.png" width="60%" alt="A Grayscale image titled 'smokey.gif' is shown. The image depicts a cat, likely outdoors, partially obscured by grass and shadows. The catâ€™s face and ears are clearly visible in the center, with strong contrast between light and dark areas giving it a stylized, high-contrast appearance.
">
</p>

```
Enter the image file name: smokey.gif
```
