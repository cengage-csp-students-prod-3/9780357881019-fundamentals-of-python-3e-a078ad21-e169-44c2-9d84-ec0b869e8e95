## Instructions

Write a program in the file **navigate.py** that allows the user to navigate the lines of text in a file. The program should prompt the user for a filename and input the lines of text into a list. The program then enters a loop in which it prints the number of lines in the file and prompts the user for a line number. Actual line numbers range from 1 to the number of lines in the file. If the input is 0, the program quits. Otherwise, the program prints the line associated with that number. (LO: 5.1)

You can use either the **navigate.py** file or create a new file in this environment to test your program's functionality.

> Note: The tests for this exercise use external text files. As a result, the test feedback might reference text that is not referenced in this lab. Double check when running your program that it displays the correct line when prompted.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter the input file name: text.txt
The file has 5 lines.
Enter a line number [0 to quit]: 2
2 :  Bob

The file has 5 lines.
Enter a line number [0 to quit]: 0
```
