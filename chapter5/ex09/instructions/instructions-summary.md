## Instructions

In the therapist program, when the patient addresses the therapist personally, the therapist’s reply does not change persons appropriately. To see an example of this problem, test the program with “you are not a helpful therapist.” Fix this problem by repairing the dictionary of replacements in the file **doctor.py**. (LO: 5.3)

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Good morning, I hope you are well today.
What can I do for you?

>> I wanted to talk about my day
Many of my patients tell me the same thing.

>> because you are a therapist, right?
Can you explain why because I are a therapist, right?

>> you sound funny
Can you explain why I sound funny

...
```
