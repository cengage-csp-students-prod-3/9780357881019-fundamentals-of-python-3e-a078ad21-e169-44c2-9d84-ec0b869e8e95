## Instructions

A group of statisticians at a local college has asked you to create a set of functions that compute the `median` and `mode` of a set of numbers, as defined in _Section 5.4_.Define these functions in a module named **stats.py**. Also include a function named `mean`, which computes the average of a set of numbers. Each function should expect a list of numbers as an argument and return a single number. Each function should return **0** if the list is empty. Include a `main` function that tests the three statistical functions with a given list. (LO: 5.1, 5.2)

An example of the program is shown below:

```
List: [8, 2, 5, 3, 9, 6, 2, 7]
Mode: 2
Median: 5.5
Mean: 5.25
```
