## Instructions

A bit shift is a procedure whereby the bits in a bit string are moved to the left or to the right. For example, we can shift the bits in the string 1011 two places to the left to produce the string 1110. Note that the leftmost two bits are wrapped around to the right side of the string in this operation.

Examples of the programs are shown below:

```
#shiftleft.py
Enter a string of bits: 0001
0010
```

```
#shiftright.py
Enter a string of bits: 0010
0001
```
