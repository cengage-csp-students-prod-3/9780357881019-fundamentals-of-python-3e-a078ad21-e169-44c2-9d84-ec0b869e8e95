## Instructions

Write a script named **numberlines.py**. This script creates a program listing from a source program. This script should prompt the user for the names of two files. The input filename could be the name of the script itself, but be careful to use a different output filename! The script copies the lines of text from the input file to the output file, numbering each line as it goes. The line numbers should be right-justified in four columns, so that the format of a line in the output file looks like this example:

```
1> This is the first line of text.
```

(LO: 4.5)

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter the input file name: numberlines.py
Enter the output file name: outfile.txt
```
