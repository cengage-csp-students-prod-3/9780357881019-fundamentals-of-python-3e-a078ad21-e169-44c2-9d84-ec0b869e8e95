## Instructions

Use the strategy of the decimal to binary conversion and the bit shift left operation defined in Programming Exercise 5 to code a new encryption algorithm in the file **encrypt.py**. The algorithm should add 1 to each characterâ€™s numeric ASCII value, convert it to a bit string, and shift the bits of this string one place to the left. A single-space character in the encrypted string separates the resulting bit strings. (LO: 4.1, 4.4)

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter a message: Hello World!
0010011 1001101 1011011 1011011 1100001 000011 0110001 1100001 1100111 1011011 1001011 000101
```
