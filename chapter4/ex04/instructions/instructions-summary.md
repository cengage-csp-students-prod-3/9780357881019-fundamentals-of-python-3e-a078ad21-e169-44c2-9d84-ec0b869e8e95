## Instructions

Octal numbers have a base of eight and the digits 0â€“7. Write the scripts **octaltodecimal.py** and **decimaltooctal.py**, which convert numbers between the octal and decimal representations of integers. These scripts use algorithms that are similar to those of the `binaryToDecimal` and `decimalToBinary` scripts developed in Section 4-3. (LO: 4.1, 4.3)

An example of the program is shown below:

```
# decimaltooctal.py
Enter a decimal integer: 111
The octal representation is 157
```

```
# octaltodecimal.py
Enter a string of octal digits: 157
The integer value is 111
```
