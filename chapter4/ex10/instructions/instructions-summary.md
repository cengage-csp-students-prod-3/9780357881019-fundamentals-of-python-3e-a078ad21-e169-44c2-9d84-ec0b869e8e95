## Instructions

Write a script named **dif.py**. This script should prompt the user for the names of two text files and compare the contents of the two files to see if they are the same. If they are, the script should simply output "**Yes**". If they are not, the script should output "**No**", followed by the first lines of each file that differ from each other. The input loop should read and compare lines from each file. The loop should break as soon as a pair of different lines is found. (LO: 4.1, 4.5)

```
Enter the first file name: textFile1.txt
Enter the second file name: textFile2.txt

```

```
Enter the first file name: textFile1.txt
Enter the second file name: textFile3.txt
