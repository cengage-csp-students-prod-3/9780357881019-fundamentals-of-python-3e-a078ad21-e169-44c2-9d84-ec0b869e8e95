## Instructions

For this exercise, write a program that contains an introductory docstring. This documentation should describe what the program will do (analysis) and how it will do it (design the program in the form of a pseudocode algorithm). Include suitable prompts for all inputs, and label all outputs appropriately. After you have coded a program, be sure to test it with a reasonable set of legitimate inputs.

```
Enter the wage: $2000
Enter the regular hours: 8
Enter the overtime hours: 2
The total weekly pay is $22000.0
```

## Your Tasks

An employeeâ€™s total weekly pay equals the hourly wage multiplied by the total number of regular hours plus any overtime pay. Overtime pay equals the total overtime hours multiplied by 1.5 times the hourly wage.
