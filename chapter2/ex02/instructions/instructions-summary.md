## Instructions

For this exercise, write a program that contains an introductory docstring. This documentation should describe what the program will do (analysis) and how it will do it (design the program in the form of a pseudocode algorithm). Include suitable prompts for all inputs, and label all outputs appropriately. After you have coded a program, be sure to test it with a reasonable set of legitimate inputs.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter the cube's edge: 5
The surface area is 150.0 square units.
```

## Your Tasks

You can calculate the surface area of a cube if you know the length of an edge.
