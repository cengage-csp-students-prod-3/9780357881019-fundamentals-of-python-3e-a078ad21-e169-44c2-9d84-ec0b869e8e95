## Instructions

For this exercise, write a program that contains an introductory docstring. This documentation should describe what the program will do (analysis) and how it will do it (design the program in the form of a pseudocode algorithm). Include suitable prompts for all inputs, and label all outputs appropriately. After you have coded a program, be sure to test it with a reasonable set of legitimate inputs.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter the number of years: 12
Light travels 113529600000000000 meters in 12 years.
```

## Your Tasks

Light travels at 3 \* 10‚Å∏ meters per second. A light-year is the distance a light beam travels in one year.
