## Instructions

For this exercise, write a program that contains an introductory docstring. This documentation should describe what the program will do (analysis) and how it will do it (design the program in the form of a pseudocode algorithm). Include suitable prompts for all inputs, and label all outputs appropriately. After you have coded a program, be sure to test it with a reasonable set of legitimate inputs.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter the gross income: 50000
Enter the number of dependents: 2
The income tax is $6800.0
```

## Your Tasks

The tax calculator program of the case study outputs a floating-point number that might show more than two digits of precision.
