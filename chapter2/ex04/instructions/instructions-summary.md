## Instructions

For this exercise, write a program that contains an introductory docstring. This documentation should describe what the program will do (analysis) and how it will do it (design the program in the form of a pseudocode algorithm). Include suitable prompts for all inputs, and label all outputs appropriately. After you have coded a program, be sure to test it with a reasonable set of legitimate inputs.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter the sphere's radius: 12
Diameter     : 24.0
Circumference: 75.39822368615503
Surface area : 1809.5573684677208
Volume       : 7238.229473870883
```
