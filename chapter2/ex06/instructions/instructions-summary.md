## Instructions

For this exercise, write a program that contains an introductory docstring. This documentation should describe what the program will do (analysis) and how it will do it (design the program in the form of a pseudocode algorithm). Include suitable prompts for all inputs, and label all outputs appropriately. After you have coded a program, be sure to test it with a reasonable set of legitimate inputs.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
Enter the object's mass: 250
Enter the object's velocity: 12
The object's momentum is 3000.0
The object's kinetic energy is 18000.0
```

## Your Tasks

The kinetic energy of a moving object is given by the formula _KE = (1/2) mv²_, where _m_ is the object’s mass and _v_ is its velocity.
